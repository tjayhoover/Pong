# pong
A modified version of pong coded in Javascript
I utilized the canvas element in HTML to create the play area. Then I wrote several Javascript functions that can draw elements to the canvas, such as the ball and the paddles. A refresh function draws all the elements, and the main game function calls refresh around 200 times per second to animate the motion.

In my version of pong, the computer cannot lose. The object of the game is to beat your previous high score. There are three difficulty settings, which change the paddle size, the ball speed, and the range of angles of the ball's path.

The webpage is not responsive. That would be a good future update.
