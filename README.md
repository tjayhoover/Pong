# Pong
A modified version of Pong.

You can view the site here: https://tjayhoover.github.io/Pong/

I would like to credit this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl0KXCa5pJk
I got the main game functions from the video; however I ended up modifying most of the functions and adding features.
The video really helped me to understand how powerful functions are in Javascript.

I utilized the canvas element in HTML to create the play area. Then I wrote several Javascript functions that can draw elements to the canvas, such as the ball and the paddles. A refresh function draws all the elements, and the main game function calls refresh around 200 times per second to animate the motion.

In my version of pong, the computer cannot lose. The object of the game is to beat your previous high score. There are three difficulty settings, which change the paddle size, the ball speed, and the angle of the ball's path.

The webpage is not optimized for mobile screens. That would be a good future update.
